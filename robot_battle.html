		<p>
			By the year 2052, robots were everywhere.  They did the jobs that humans did not want to do.  They became the friends of humans. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Then, one day, it all changed.  A bad robot found that it could fry the circuits of the good robots by asking them questions!
			More robots like this appeared.
		</p>
		<p>
			There was only one thing to do.  The humans built a robot that could answer the questions!  
			If it answered enough questions correctly, the bad robots would get so angry they would explode!
