## Robot Battle

[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/54710dfdecb7410fbdfd07afb48d9bba)](https://www.codacy.com/app/me_116/robotBattle?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=nelsonwright/robotBattle&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

Robot Battle is a browser-based game that aims to teach children (or adults) arithmetic.  As most children use tablets, it will be optimised for that size of browser and orientation, i.e. landscape.

I'll be refactoring as I go, but the main part of the game will be in Javascript.

To start the game, just point your browser at: robot_battle.html.  You can see a working build at: http://www.nelsonwright.co.uk/robot_battle/robot_battle.html

Feel free to get in touch if you want to get involved, or just submit a pull request.  You can find me at:

Thanks,

Nelson
