## Robot Battle

Robot Battle is a browser-based game that aims to teach children (or adults) arithmetic.  As children often use tablets, especially in schools, it will be optimised for that size of browser and orientation, i.e. landscape.

I'll be refactoring as I go, but the game will be in JavaScript.

To start the game, just point your browser at: index.html.

Feel free to get in touch if you want to get involved, or submit a pull request.
