## Robot Battle

Robot Battle is a browser-based game that aims to teach children (or adults) multiplication.  As most children use tablets, it will be optimised for that size of browser and orientation, i.e. landscape.

I'll be refactoring as I go, but the main part of the game will be in Javascript.

To start the game, just point your browser at: robot_battle.html

Feel free to drop me a line if you can think of any parts of the code that could be improved, or if you wish to colloborate or submit a pull request.  You can find me at:
